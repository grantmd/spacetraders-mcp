# SpaceTraders MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration between any MCP client and the SpaceTraders API, enabling automation, analysis, and discussion about the current state of your SpaceTraders game state.

**Most of this is being "written" via LLM tools as a personal experiment, which is probably unsurprising given the target audience, but I wanted to make that clear upfront.**

## ‚ú® Features

- **ü§ñ Intelligent Game Assistant**: Get contextual advice and strategic recommendations
- **üìä Real-time Data Access**: Automatic access to your ships, contracts, and systems
- **üõ†Ô∏è Automated Actions**: Execute complex operations through natural language
- **üó∫Ô∏è Smart Exploration**: Intelligent system mapping and facility discovery
- **üìà Strategic Analysis**: Contract optimization and fleet management recommendations
- **üö¢ Advanced Ship Management**: Individual ship monitoring with real-time cooldown tracking
- **üì¶ Contract Workflow**: Complete contract delivery system with incremental goods delivery

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Java 8+ (for OpenAPI code generation)
- Any MCP Client
- SpaceTraders API token ([Get one here](https://spacetraders.io))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grantmd/spacetraders-mcp.git
   cd spacetraders-mcp
   ```

2. **Generate the SpaceTraders API client:**
   ```bash
   # This downloads the latest SpaceTraders OpenAPI spec and generates the Go client
   make generate-client
   ```

3. **Build the server:**
   ```bash
   go build -o spacetraders-mcp
   ```

4. **Set up your SpaceTraders credentials:**
   ```bash
   export SPACETRADERS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

5. **Configure Claude Desktop (or other client):**

   Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude macOS):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "spacetraders": {
         "command": "/path/to/spacetraders-mcp/spacetraders-mcp",
         "args": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart your client** and start exploring!

### First Steps

Once configured, try these commands:

- **"Show me my current SpaceTraders status"** - Get a complete overview
- **"What systems should I explore next?"** - Get strategic recommendations
- **"Help me optimize my fleet"** - Analyze and improve your ships
- **"Find the best trading opportunities"** - Discover profitable routes

6. "Check cooldown for TRADER-1" - Monitor when ready for next action
7. "Fulfill the contract" - Complete and claim rewards
```

**Fleet Cooldown Management:**
```
1. "Show me all ship cooldowns" - Monitor fleet availability
2. "Which ships are ready for mining?" - Find available extraction ships
3. "Check ship MINER-1 detailed status" - Comprehensive operational analysis
4. "Plan next actions based on cooldowns" - Strategic fleet coordination
```

**System Exploration:**
```
"Explore system X1-DF55 and tell me what facilities are available"
```

**Fleet Management:**
```
"Where are all my ships and what should I do with them?"
