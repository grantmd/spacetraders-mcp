# Ship Resources Documentation

This document describes the individual ship resources and cooldown functionality implemented in the SpaceTraders MCP server.

## Overview

The SpaceTraders MCP server now supports detailed, real-time information about individual ships through dedicated resources. These resources provide enhanced analysis and operational status beyond the basic ship list.

## New Resources

**URI Pattern:** `spacetraders://ships/{shipSymbol}`

**Description:** Provides comprehensive information about a specific ship including detailed analysis of its operational status, capabilities, and recommendations.

**Example URIs:**
- `spacetraders://ships/MYSHIP-1`
- `spacetraders://ships/TRADER-A2`
- `spacetraders://ships/MINER-01`

**Response Structure:**

## Usage Examples

### Check Ship Status
```bash
# Get comprehensive ship information
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "resources/read",
    "params": {
      "uri": "spacetraders://ships/MYSHIP-1"
    }
  }'
```

### Monitor Cooldown
```bash
# Get real-time cooldown status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "resources/read",
    "params": {
      "uri": "spacetraders://ships/MYSHIP-1/cooldown"
    }
  }'
```

### Batch Ship Monitoring
```bash
# Check multiple ships
for ship in MYSHIP-1 MYSHIP-2 MYSHIP-3; do
  echo "Checking $ship cooldown..."
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",
      \"id\": 1,
      \"method\": \"resources/read\",
      \"params\": {
        \"uri\": \"spacetraders://ships/$ship/cooldown\"
      }
    }"
done
```

## Implementation Details

### Client Methods

**New Client Methods:**
- `GetShip(shipSymbol string) (*Ship, error)` - Get individual ship details
- `GetShipCooldown(shipSymbol string) (*Cooldown, error)` - Get ship cooldown status

**Special Handling:**
- The GetShipCooldown method properly handles 204 No Content responses when no cooldown is active
- Returns nil for cooldown when ship is ready
- Includes comprehensive error handling for invalid ship symbols

### Resource Handlers

**ShipResource:**
- Extracts ship symbol from URI using regex pattern matching
- Combines ship data with cooldown information
- Performs comprehensive analysis and generates recommendations
- Handles invalid ship symbols gracefully

**ShipCooldownResource:**
- Dedicated cooldown monitoring with real-time status
- Priority-based status classification
- Action availability determination
- Time formatting and progress calculation

### Performance Considerations

**Caching:**
- Resources fetch fresh data on each request for real-time accuracy
- Cooldown information is time-sensitive and not cached
- Individual ship data includes cooldown for efficiency

**API Calls:**
- Individual ship resource makes 1-2 API calls (ship + optional cooldown)
- Cooldown resource makes 1 API call
- Error handling prevents cascading failures

## Error Handling

### Invalid Ship Symbols
- Returns descriptive error messages for invalid ship symbols
- Maintains consistent error response format
- Logs errors for debugging

### Network Errors
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Informative error messages
- Proper HTTP status code handling

### Cooldown Edge Cases
- Handles 204 No Content responses properly
- Manages expired cooldowns
- Deals with missing cooldown data

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Enhanced Tool Responses
The ship resources complement existing tools by providing:
- Pre-action ship status checks
- Post-action cooldown monitoring
- Operational readiness verification

### Workflow Integration
1. **Pre-Action Check:** Use ship resource to verify operational status
2. **Execute Action:** Use existing tools (extract, scan, navigate)
3. **Post-Action Monitor:** Use cooldown resource to track readiness
4. **Plan Next Action:** Use recommendations for decision making

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy
- Use cooldown resources for real-time monitoring
- Use ship resources for comprehensive status checks
- Monitor multiple ships in parallel for fleet management

### Action Planning
- Check cooldown status before planning ship actions
- Use recommendations for optimal timing
- Monitor cargo and fuel levels for logistics planning

### Fleet Management
- Use ship resources to assess fleet readiness
- Monitor cooldowns across all ships
- Plan actions based on ship availability

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Fleet-wide cooldown summary resource
- Cooldown notification system
- Automated fleet scheduling based on cooldown status
- Historical cooldown analysis

### Potential Integrations
- Integration with contract delivery workflows
- Mining operation optimization
- Trading route planning
- Fleet coordination tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Invalid Ship Symbol:**
```
Error: Invalid ship cooldown resource URI. 
Expected format: spacetraders://ships/{shipSymbol}/cooldown
```
Solution: Verify ship symbol exists and URI format is correct.

**Network Timeouts:**
```
Error: Failed to fetch cooldown for ship MYSHIP-1: context deadline exceeded
```
Solution: Check network connectivity and API availability.

**Ship Not Found:**
```
Error: Failed to get ship: ship not found
```
Solution: Verify ship symbol exists and belongs to your agent.

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to see detailed API call information:
```bash
SPACETRADERS_DEBUG=true ./spacetraders-mcp
```

## Summary

Key benefits:
- Real-time cooldown monitoring
- Enhanced operational intelligence
- Actionable recommendations
- Comprehensive ship analysis
- Seamless integration with existing tools

These resources form the foundation for advanced fleet management and automated ship operations in the SpaceTraders universe.
