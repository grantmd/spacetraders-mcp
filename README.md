# SpaceTraders MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the SpaceTraders API. This server provides tools to interact with your SpaceTraders agent and game data through MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop.

## Features

- **Agent Information Resource**: Access your agent's current information including credits, headquarters, faction, and ship count via the resource `spacetraders://agent/info`
- **Ships List Resource**: View all your ships with detailed information including location, status, cargo, and equipment via the resource `spacetraders://ships/list`
- **Contracts List Resource**: View available contracts with terms, payments, and delivery requirements via the resource `spacetraders://contracts/list`
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in structured logging with API call timing, performance metrics, and component-specific debugging
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, extensible codebase that makes it easy to add new SpaceTraders API resources and tools

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.4 or later
- A SpaceTraders API token (get one by registering at [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/))
- An MCP-compatible client (like Claude Desktop) that supports resources

## Setup

1. **Clone and build the project:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd spacetraders-mcp
   go mod tidy
   go build -o spacetraders-mcp .
   ```

2. **Configure your API token:**
   The server uses Viper for configuration management. You can configure your API token in multiple ways:
   
   **Option 1: Create a `.env` file (recommended):**
   ```
   SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Set environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
   ```

   You can get your API token by:
   - Registering a new agent at https://spacetraders.io/
   - Or using an existing token if you already have an agent

3. **Test the server:**
   ```bash
   ./test_mcp.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

The MCP server communicates via stdin/stdout:

```bash
./spacetraders-mcp

## üöÄ Quick Start: System Exploration Workflow

For the best experience with Claude Desktop, follow this recommended workflow:

### 1. **Understand Your Current Situation**
```
current_location
```
This shows where all your ships are and what facilities are nearby.

### 2. **Explore Your Current System**
```
system_overview system_symbol=X1-YOUR-SYSTEM
```
Gets a complete overview of facilities, shipyards, markets, and opportunities.

### 3. **Find Specific Facilities**
```
find_waypoints system_symbol=X1-YOUR-SYSTEM trait=SHIPYARD
find_waypoints system_symbol=X1-YOUR-SYSTEM trait=MARKETPLACE
```
Quickly locate exactly what you need.

### 4. **Navigate and Take Action**
```
navigate_ship ship_symbol=YOUR_SHIP waypoint_symbol=TARGET_WAYPOINT
purchase_ship ship_type=SHIP_MINING_DRONE waypoint_symbol=SHIPYARD_WAYPOINT
```

### 5. **Check Market Opportunities**
Use resources like: `spacetraders://systems/X1-SYSTEM/waypoints/X1-MARKETPLACE/market`

**This workflow eliminates guessing and provides Claude with complete system knowledge for strategic decision-making.**

## Important: How MCP Resources Work

**Key Understanding:** MCP resources are **NOT automatically loaded** by clients like Claude Desktop. They work like web pages - they exist at specific URIs but are only fetched when explicitly requested.

### What This Means

- ‚ùå **Claude doesn't automatically know about your agent, ships, contracts, etc.**
- ‚úÖ **You must explicitly ask Claude to read resources**
- ‚úÖ **Use the status tool for quick overviews**

### How to Use Resources

Instead of asking "What ships do I have?", try:
- "Get my status summary"
- "Read the spacetraders://ships/list resource"
- "Show me my agent information"
- "Read my contracts list"

### Smart Workflow for Contract Management

1. **Check Status**: "Get my status summary" - See credits, ships, contracts
2. **Analyze Contracts**: "Get contract info" - See requirements and profitability  
3. **Check Fleet**: "Analyze fleet capabilities" - See if you have the right ships
4. **Buy Ships**: "Purchase a SHIP_MINING_DRONE at X1-SYSTEM-SHIPYARD" - Get needed ships
5. **Accept Contract**: "Accept contract [contract-id]" - Commit to the contract

### Available Prompts

Prompts are **conversation starters** that automatically guide Claude to read relevant resources and provide strategic analysis. Instead of manually asking Claude to read specific resources, use these prompts for guided interactions:

### For Trading and Commerce
- "Find the best trading routes in my current system"
- "Show me market prices at all marketplaces in X1-[SYSTEM]"
- "Where can I sell goods for the highest profit?"

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering both unit tests and integration tests. Tests have been converted from shell scripts to native Go tests for better reliability and maintainability.

### Running Tests

The easiest way to run tests is using the provided test runner or Makefile:

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration tests that don't require API access)
make test

# Run unit tests only
make test-unit

# Run integration tests only  
make test-integration

# Run full integration tests with real API calls (requires SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN)
make test-full

# Or use the Go test runner directly
go run ./cmd/test_runner.go
go run ./cmd/test_runner.go --integration  # For full API integration tests
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** (`./pkg/...`): Test individual packages and functions without external dependencies
2. **Integration Tests** (`./test/...`): Test the complete MCP server functionality
   - Protocol compliance tests (no API token required)
   - Resource structure validation (no API token required)
   - Server startup/shutdown tests (no API token required)
   - API-dependent tests (require `SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN`, will be skipped if not provided)

### Manual Testing

You can also test the server manually using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages:

1. **List available resources:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "resources/list"}' | ./spacetraders-mcp
   ```

2. **Read agent info resource:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "resources/read", "params": {"uri": "spacetraders://agent/info"}}' | ./spacetraders-mcp
   ```

### Test Coverage

Tests cover:
- MCP protocol compliance (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- Resource listing and reading
- Error handling for invalid resources
- API authentication error handling
- Server graceful shutdown
- Multiple request handling
- All package functionality

### Adding New Resources

To add new SpaceTraders API resources:

1. **Add API method**: Extend `pkg/spacetraders/client.go` with the new API endpoint method and response types
2. **Create resource handler**: Add a new file in `pkg/resources/` (e.g., `contracts.go`) implementing the `ResourceHandler` interface
3. **Register resource**: Add your new resource to the `registerResources()` function in `pkg/resources/registry.go`
4. **Add tests**: Create unit tests for your resource handler
5. **Test**: Run `make test` to verify your new resource works

## CI/CD and Automation

This project uses GitHub Actions for comprehensive CI/CD automation:

### Workflows

#### 1. **Main CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Runs on every push and pull request:
- **Multi-version testing**: Tests against Go 1.21 and 1.22
- **Code quality**: `go vet`, `gofmt`, linting with `golangci-lint`
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test runner
- **Security scanning**: `gosec` and `govulncheck`
- **Cross-platform builds**: Linux, macOS, Windows (AMD64, ARM64)
- **Coverage reporting**: Uploads to Codecov

#### 2. **Integration Tests** (`.github/workflows/integration.yml`)
Scheduled daily and manually triggered:
- **Real API testing**: Uses `SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN` secret for live API tests
- **Automated issue creation**: Creates GitHub issues on test failures
- **Fallback testing**: Runs protocol tests when no API token is available
- **Test reporting**: Generates comprehensive test reports

#### 3. **Release Automation** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
Triggered on version tags:
- **Pre-release testing**: Full test suite before building release
- **Multi-platform binaries**: Builds for all supported platforms
- **Docker images**: Pushes to Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry
- **GitHub releases**: Automatic release creation with changelog
- **Checksums**: SHA256 checksums for all binaries

### Secrets Configuration

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Required for integration tests
SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN=your_spacetraders_token_here

# Optional for Docker releases
DOCKER_USERNAME=your_dockerhub_username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your_dockerhub_password

# Optional for notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
```

### Automated Dependency Updates

**Dependabot** automatically:
- Updates Go modules weekly
- Updates GitHub Actions weekly
- Updates Docker base images weekly
- Groups minor/patch updates
- Prioritizes security updates

- [ ] Unit tests (all packages)
- [ ] Integration tests (protocol compliance)
- [ ] Security scans (gosec, govulncheck)
- [ ] Code formatting (gofmt)
- [ ] Linting (golangci-lint)
- [ ] Cross-platform builds

### Release Process

1. **Create a version tag**: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. **Automated release**: GitHub Actions will:
   - Run full test suite
   - Build multi-platform binaries
   - Create GitHub release with changelog
   - Push Docker images
   - Generate checksums

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run tests locally
make test

# Run with real API (requires token)
make test-full

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-integration

# Format and lint code
make fmt
make lint

# Security scan
make security
```

**Example structure for a new resource:**
```go
// pkg/resources/systems.go
type SystemsResource struct {
    client *spacetraders.Client
    logger *logging.Logger
}

func NewSystemsResource(client *spacetraders.Client, logger *logging.Logger) *SystemsResource {
    return &SystemsResource{
        client: client,
        logger: logger,
    }
}

func (r *SystemsResource) Resource() mcp.Resource {
    return mcp.Resource{
        URI:         "spacetraders://systems/list",
        Name:        "Systems List",
        Description: "List of all star systems",
        MIMEType:    "application/json",
    }
}

func (r *SystemsResource) Handler() func(...) (...) {
    return func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.ReadResourceRequest) ([]mcp.ResourceContents, error) {
        ctxLogger := r.logger.WithContext(ctx, "systems-resource")
        ctxLogger.Debug("Fetching systems from API")
        
        start := time.Now()
        systems, err := r.client.GetSystems()
        duration := time.Since(start)
        
        if err != nil {
            ctxLogger.Error("Failed to fetch systems: %v", err)
            ctxLogger.APICall("/systems", 0, duration.String())
            // Handle error...
        }
        
        ctxLogger.APICall("/systems", 200, duration.String())
        ctxLogger.Info("Successfully retrieved %d systems", len(systems))
        ctxLogger.ResourceRead(request.Params.URI, true)
        
        // Format and return response...
    }
}
```

### Adding Tools

For interactive SpaceTraders API actions (like trading, navigation):

1. **Add API method**: Extend `pkg/spacetraders/client.go` with the action method
2. **Create tool handler**: Add a new file in `pkg/tools/` implementing the `ToolHandler` interface  
3. **Register tool**: Add your new tool to the `registerTools()` function in `pkg/tools/registry.go`
4. **Enable tools**: Update `main.go` to enable tool capabilities: `server.WithToolCapabilities(true, false)`
5. **Test**: Verify your new tool works correctly

### Architecture Benefits

The modular structure provides:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each package has a clear responsibility
- **Easy testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Adding new resources/tools is straightforward
- **Maintainability**: Code is organized and easy to navigate
- **Reusability**: SpaceTraders client can be used independently
- **Comprehensive logging**: Built-in structured logging with performance metrics
- **Debugging support**: Component-specific logging with context and timing information

### Error Handling

The server uses proper MCP error handling:
- API errors are returned as resource contents with error messages
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- Invalid resource URIs return appropriate error responses
- Tools (when implemented) use proper tool error handling
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C with no error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Performance tracking for all API calls

## API Reference

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Error Handling

#### Problem: Getting "status: 422" without details when using navigation tools

**Solution:** This has been fixed in the latest version. Navigation tools (orbit, dock, navigate, warp, jump, patch nav) now properly expose detailed error messages from the SpaceTraders API.

**What was fixed:**
- Previously, HTTP error responses only showed status codes (e.g., "failed to orbit ship, status: 422")
- Now, error responses include the full API error message with details about what went wrong
- Fixed Content-Type header issue where POST requests with empty bodies were rejected by the API
- This applies to all navigation methods: `orbit_ship`, `dock_ship`, `navigate_ship`, `patch_ship_nav`, `warp_ship`, `jump_ship`

**Example error messages you'll now see:**
```
API request failed with status 422: {"error":{"message":"Ship must be docked to enter orbit","code":4214,"data":{"shipSymbol":"SHIP_1234","shipStatus":"IN_TRANSIT"}}}
```

Instead of just:
```
failed to orbit ship, status: 422
```

Or the Content-Type error:
```
You specified a 'Content-Type' header of 'application/json', but the request body is an empty string (which can't be parsed as valid JSON). Send an empty object (e.g. {}) instead.
```

**Common 422 errors and their meanings:**
- **Orbit:** "Ship must be docked to enter orbit" - Ship is not at a waypoint or is in transit
- **Dock:** "Ship must be in orbit to dock" - Ship is not in orbit around a waypoint
- **Navigate:** "Ship must be in orbit to navigate" - Ship is docked or in transit
- **Warp:** "Ship does not have warp drive installed" - Ship lacks warp capability
- **Jump:** "Ship does not have jump drive installed" - Ship lacks jump capability

### System Exploration and Discovery

#### Problem: Claude can't find waypoints with specific facilities

**Solution:** Use the new exploration tools to efficiently discover and navigate to facilities.

**New tools available:**

1. **`find_waypoints`** - Search for specific facilities by trait:
   ```
   find_waypoints system_symbol=X1-FM66 trait=SHIPYARD
   ```

2. **`system_overview`** - Get comprehensive system analysis:
   ```
   system_overview system_symbol=X1-FM66
   ```

3. **`current_location`** - Analyze your fleet's current positions:
   ```
   current_location
   ```

**Common traits to search for:**
- `SHIPYARD` - Build and buy ships
- `MARKETPLACE` - Trade goods and check prices
- `ASTEROID_FIELD` - Mine resources
- `JUMP_GATE` - Travel to other systems
- `FUEL_STATION` - Refuel ships

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Find all shipyards in current system
find_waypoints system_symbol=X1-FM66 trait=SHIPYARD

# 2. Check what ships are available
# Use resource: spacetraders://systems/X1-FM66/waypoints/X1-FM66-SHIPYARD/shipyard

# 3. Navigate to the shipyard
navigate_ship ship_symbol=SHIP_1234 waypoint_symbol=X1-FM66-SHIPYARD

# 4. Purchase a ship
purchase_ship ship_type=SHIP_MINING_DRONE waypoint_symbol=X1-FM66-SHIPYARD
```

### MCP Resource Issues

#### Problem: Claude doesn't know about my agent/ships/contracts

**Cause:** MCP resources are not automatically loaded. They're only fetched when explicitly requested.

**Solutions:**
1. Use the status summary tool: "Get my status summary"
2. Explicitly request resources:
   - "Read the spacetraders://agent/info resource"
   - "Show me the spacetraders://ships/list resource"
   - "Read my contracts from spacetraders://contracts/list"

#### Problem: "Resource not found" errors

**Cause:** Usually incorrect URI format or missing system/waypoint symbols.

**Solutions:**
1. Check URI format exactly matches the patterns:
   - `spacetraders://systems/X1-SYSTEM/waypoints`
   - `spacetraders://systems/X1-SYSTEM/waypoints/X1-WAYPOINT/shipyard`
2. Ensure system and waypoint symbols are valid
3. Use the status tool first to get valid system names

#### Problem: Debug logs show no resource requests

**Cause:** Claude Desktop isn't calling your resources automatically.

**Solutions:**
1. Ask Claude explicitly: "What MCP resources are available?"
2. Request specific resources by name or URI
3. Use the status summary tool for automated data fetching

### Other Common Issues

1. **"SPACETRADERS_API_TOKEN not found in configuration"**
   - Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains the token, or set the environment variable
   - Check that the token is properly quoted in the `.env` file
   - Verify that Viper can read your configuration (check file permissions)

2. **"API request failed with status 401"**
   - Your API token is invalid or expired
   - Register a new agent or check your existing token

3. **"Failed to make request"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the SpaceTraders API is accessible

4. **Build errors**
   - Ensure you have Go 1.24.4 or later
   - Run `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies
   - Check that all required packages (including Viper) are properly installed

5. **Configuration file issues**
   - Viper supports multiple configuration formats (.env, .yaml, .json, etc.)
   - If using environment variables, make sure they're properly exported
   - The server will work with environment variables even if no .env file exists

### Server Management

The server supports graceful shutdown:
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server cleanly
- No error messages are displayed on normal shutdown
- The server automatically handles signal cleanup

### Logging

The server provides comprehensive logging capabilities:

#### Built-in Logging Levels
- **ERROR**: Server errors, API failures, configuration issues
- **INFO**: Server startup, API call timing, successful operations, resource metrics
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operation tracing, response sizes, component-specific debugging

#### Log Output Examples
```
[INFO] 2025/06/20 18:00:16 Starting SpaceTraders MCP Server
[DEBUG] 2025/06/20 18:00:16 [agent-resource] Fetching agent information from API
[INFO] 2025/06/20 18:00:16 [agent-resource] API call: /my/agent -> 200 (513ms)
[INFO] 2025/06/20 18:00:16 [agent-resource] Successfully retrieved agent info for: CORNTAB
[DEBUG] 2025/06/20 18:00:16 [agent-resource] Agent resource response size: 199 bytes
```

#### Log Features
- **Component Identification**: Each log shows which resource/component generated it
- **API Performance Tracking**: HTTP status codes and response times for all SpaceTraders API calls
- **Resource Metrics**: Response sizes, item counts, and operation success rates
- **Context Awareness**: Logs include relevant context like agent symbols, ship counts, etc.

#### MCP Client Logging
The server supports MCP logging notifications that can be sent to compatible clients:
- Configurable log levels via MCP `logging/setLevel` requests
- Structured log messages sent as MCP notifications
- Integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients that support logging

#### Viewing Logs
- **stderr**: All logs are written to stderr for easy redirection
- **Silent JSON**: stdout only contains clean JSON-RPC responses
- **Log Filtering**: Redirect stderr to `/dev/null` to suppress logs: `./spacetraders-mcp 2>/dev/null`
